This is the default security policy that applies to all my projects by default.

## Reporting Security Issues

Please do not post information about unresolved security vulnerabilities in public. If you have found any potential vulnerabilities in projects maintained by me:

- All my repositories should have enabled [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) so you can report there. Feel free to leave any fields empty if you are uncertain. We can fill them later.
- Alternatively, you can write an email to <ouuansteve@gmail.com>.

## Supported Versions

Unless specified elsewhere, only the master branch and the latest release (if any) are supported.
